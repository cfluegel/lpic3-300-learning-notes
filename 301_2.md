# 301.2 Samba Configuration (weight: 4)

## Key knowledge

* Manage Samba server file-based configuration
* Manage of Samba server registry-based configuration
* Manage of Samba configuration parameters and variables
* Understand Samba server roles and security modes
* Configure Samba to use TLS
* Check the validity of a Samba configuration
* Troubleshoot and debug configuration problems with Samba
* Understand Windows tools used to configure a Samba Server

## The following is a partial list of the used files, terms and utilities:

* smb.conf
  * security
  * server role
  * server string
  * server services
  * ~~tls enabled~~
  * ~~tls keyfile~~
  * ~~tls certfile~~
  * tls dh params file
  * ~~tls cafile~~
  * config backend
  * registry shares
  * include
  * vfs objects
* samba-regedit
* HKLM\Software\Samba\
* REG_SZ, REG_MULTI_SZ
* testparm
* net registry (including relevant subcommands)
* Microsoft RSAT Tools
* Microsoft MMC
* Microsoft ADSI Edit
* Microsoft LDP
* Microsoft Regedit

# Notes

Direcotries: Please check with the distribution. The official documentation store everything under /usr/local/samba

## SSL
* Private key must not have a password
* Must be in PEM Format (base64 DER)
* Samba generates a self-signed certificate   that is valid for 700 days
* You can generate a private key instead and create a CSR and request a cert from a CA

### SSL Create Self-Signed
In case you use something like EasyRSA, you have to add the CA cert to the ```tls cafile``` configuration option,
otherwise it may fail.

```bash
# openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myKey.pem -nodes -x509 -days 365 -out myCert.pem
# chmod 600 myKey.pem
```

Samba Configuration options
```
tls enabled  = yes
tls keyfile  = tls/myKey.pem
tls certfile = tls/myCert.pem
tls cafile   =
```

### USE a CSR Request
Generate key and CSR. Answer all the ssl questions accordingly

```bash
# openssl genrsa -out myKey.pem 2048
# openssl req -new -key myKey.pem -out myCSR.pem
```

```
tls enabled  = yes
tls keyfile  = tls/myKey.pem
tls certfile = tls/myCert.pem
tls cafile   = tls/myIntermediate .pem  # if not required, set empty
```
myIntermediate might have to be all certificates. Intermediate+rootCA. Like it is the case with so many
other software.

### SSL Check the certificate

#### locally

self-signed
```openssl verify /usr/local/samba/private/tls/myCert.pem```

with CSR
```openssl verify /usr/local/samba/private/tls/myCert.pem -CApath /path/to/ca-file.pem```

#### remotely

```openssl s_client -showcerts -connect dc1.samdom.example.com:636```

In case you use a self hosted CA solution, you may have to add the CA as well
```openssl s_client -showcerts -connect localhost:636 -CAfile /path/to/ca-file.pem```
